# GDSC-Solution-Challenge---2023
Tackling and Viewing Life on Earth and Global wellbeing situations using Satellite Imagery Analysis. - Project

This is a website that has been created using HTML and CSS only. The project can be downloaded as a Zipped folder. Then extract the fies in your local system and then click on the HTML page "1-welcome" which will directly run on Chrome browser. 
As you start navigating thrpugh it, you will see the "Sign Up" button which redirects you to the registration page. You can register yourself there and then click on the "Register" button which will direct you to the Main page.

In the Main page you can see many hyperlinks that redirect you to different Google technologies that I have used in my project.

The second hyperlink (from the top) which is named "Look into the world and collect sights, through coding..." redirects you to Google Earth Engine (where you need to have an account with Earth Engine, preferably) which also has an inbulit code editor to login through you own Google account, to access the editor. If you haven't created an account with Earth Engine, first create in the same link, then and there and log-in.

Start the whole project, by opening the "1-welcome" html webpage, which will guide you to the next.

Thank you!
